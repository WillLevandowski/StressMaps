README

ConUS...txt contains the most up-to-date collection of 6482 focal mechanisms for (mostly) the continental U.S.
The structure is noted in the top line, commented out for use in MATLAB.
There are some non-ConUS mechanisms (e.g., from Alaska) that I haven't gotten around to weeding out yet.

The Excel spreadsheet contains more complete metadata (e.g., date/time, depth, reference).
I have not had a chance to add all of the mechanisms contained in ConUS...txt.

InSituIndicators.txt 
This file simply reformats the stress indicators (e.g., borehole breakouts) compiled by Lund-Snee and Zoback (2020).
Focal mechanism data from that compilation are not included in this file but rather are included in the datasets described above.
Note also that Lund-Snee and Zoback (2020) recapitulate all pertinent World Stress Map data and add many new data.
